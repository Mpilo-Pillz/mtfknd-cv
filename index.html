                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I love watermelon. However I still have a lot to learn about software development whether <br>
                    it‚Äôs testing, analysis, development or deployment. I have spent my entire career learning <br>
                    how to learn. However I am confident in my ability to learn. I love to learn and every working <br> 
                    opportunity is a learning opportunity. I spend most of my data, oops I mean time learning on udemy. <br> 
                    My first point of contact to leaning a framework or programming language is reading the documentation. <br>
                    Learning is my weakness as I can get too curious and get into a rabbit while trying to find out how <br> 
                    everything pieces together. Learning is also my strength (2 for the price of 1 üòÅ). My QA background <br> 
                    has gotten me obsessed with quality and simplicity, in other word I believe that every problem has to <br> 
                    be broken down into its simplest from. Note to self, this paragraph has gotten too long, I better split <br>
                    it up into smaller reusable modules/components. </p>
                    
                  <p>  
                      I would describe myself as an individual that loves to learn. I have spent a majority of my career learning <br> 
                      how to learn more efficiently and effectively and that is my greatest strength. I like to keep an open mind. <br>
                    I have worked primarily in the Quality Assurance (Testing) side of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). <br> 
                    I have spent a majority of my career working as a Test Automation Engineer. However recently I have switched to <br> 
                    work on the Development side of the SDLC currently working as a Web Developer. I work as a front-end web developer <br>
                     and I enjoy the unique challenges it brings forth on a day to day. Outside of work hours, I focus on learning full <br>
                      stack web development, and mobile app development. I enjoy learning on Udemy.

                      <br> <br>
                        My weakness is that I focus more on my technical skills and tend to neglect my business skills. <br>
                        I like to exercise, and watch a lot of Sitcoms and Japanese Anime. I am a big Marvel, DC and Starwars <br> 
                        fan. I am a sports fan, I primarily follow football, athletics, boxing and mixed martial arts. </p>
